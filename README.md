Currently, theres no UI for this tool.

You can see the results it finds by opening the inspector or devtools, either by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+I or right clicking the page and selecting "Inspect".

With devtools open you will see a "Hello, world." in the console tab if it is working properly, as well as the urls to any successfully found pages.
